DelishView
==========
An extension of Android's ListView widget offering support for smooth Drag-and-Drop, Sticky Headers, and a unique 'headers' mode that allows Drag-and-Drop reordering of section headers.

Status
======
This widget is largely obsolete and will probably not be continued unless it is converted over to the new RecyclerView.

In a large part, this was an expirement in the 'headers' mode, that allowed a user to reorder the sections of a long list without leaving the list. It was interesting, but probably not the best.

Still, much was learned and it is placed here to remind us of that.
